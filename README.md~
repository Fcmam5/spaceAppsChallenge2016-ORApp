An autonomous explorer robot equipped by a Jet-pack,
Controlled by distance , the robot can travel on Mars, draw a 2D map and avoid collisions, the Jetpack helps on fixing it on the ground while moving by generating the opposite force of gravity  or to fly .
The jetpack can also make jumps to check what’s there beyond the obstacles for example: a huge rock that the robot can’t cross.
The robot is connected to a webserver that we can control, watch and receives statistics & analytics..
Equipped by a Kinect, the robot can identify the objects and by connecting it to the web we can use all the parameters for a “machine-learning” program so we can make more smarter exploratory robots.
The robot uses solar energy, and by using a compressed gas with a pump that makes jumping possible.obot stays at his place & by the map sent while travelling we can detect where it is, what are the risks and the conditions there.
